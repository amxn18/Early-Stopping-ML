# Early Stopping in Machine Learning

Early stopping is a powerful regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in iterative training algorithms. It helps halt the training process once the model performance stops improving on a validation set.

This project contains:
1. ‚úÖ Early stopping with a **Neural Network** using Keras.
2. ‚úÖ Early stopping with **XGBoost**.
3. ‚ùå Why classical ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc., don't support early stopping.

## üß† Early Stopping in Neural Networks (Keras)

- Implemented using the `EarlyStopping` callback from `tensorflow.keras.callbacks`.
- Monitors the **validation loss** or **accuracy** during training.
- If the monitored metric doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs (called **patience**), training is stopped.
- Optionally, you can **restore the best weights** (the model state when validation performance was best).

**Key Concepts:**
- `monitor='val_loss'`: Watch validation loss during training.
- `patience=3`: Wait 3 epochs for improvement before stopping.
- `restore_best_weights=True`: Automatically revert to the best model.

This is used in a neural network trained on a binary classification dataset using `Dense` layers and `binary_crossentropy` loss.

## üå≤ Early Stopping in XGBoost

- XGBoost natively supports early stopping.
- Specify a **validation set** and **evaluation metric** (like RMSE).
- If the metric doesn‚Äôt improve for a number of boosting rounds, training halts.
- The best number of boosting rounds is automatically used for prediction.

**Key Parameters:**
- `early_stopping_rounds=10`: Stop if there's no improvement in 10 rounds.
- `eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)]`: Provide validation data.
- `eval_metric='rmse'`: Track this evaluation metric.

This is used in a regression task using `XGBRegressor`.

## ‚ùå Why Early Stopping Doesn‚Äôt Apply to Classical ML Models

Classical machine learning models like:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- k-NN

‚Ä¶do **not train in multiple epochs or rounds**. They usually:
- Train in a single pass (or batch process)
- Do not update weights iteratively like neural networks or boosting algorithms

Hence, there's **no concept of training over time**, and so **early stopping cannot be applied**.

| Model Type           | Supports Early Stopping? | How?                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Neural Network (Keras) | ‚úÖ Yes                 | `EarlyStopping` callback           |
| XGBoost                | ‚úÖ Yes                 | `early_stopping_rounds` parameter  |
| Logistic Regression / SVM / kNN | ‚ùå No         | No iterative epochs to monitor     |
